  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - food_pictures/wonton_pork_dry_noodle.jpg
    - food_pictures/broil_pork_chop_bento.jpg
    - food_pictures/fatty_pork_bento.jpg
    - food_pictures/signature_bento.jpg
    - food_pictures/spicy_chicken_bento.jpg
    - food_pictures/chicken_drumstick_bento.jpg
    - food_pictures/vagetable_bento.jpg
    - food_pictures/braised_pork_rice_bento.png
    - food_pictures/pork_intestine_with_pork_blood_soup.jpg
    - food_pictures/pork_heart_soup.jpg
    - food_pictures/radish_fish_ball_soup.jpg
    - food_pictures/vagetable_soup.jpg
    - food_pictures/fish_ball_soup.jpg
    - food_pictures/pork_blood_soup.jpg
    - food_pictures/radish_soup.jpg
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
